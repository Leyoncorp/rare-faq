#Purchasing an NFT



You can bid & purchase NFTs on RARE with Crypto or Credit Card. 

## Credit Card
### How do I add or remove a credit card
We don’t process payments in house, instead we use Moonpay  as our official payment provider. Following the bidding steps, you will see an option for credit card, and this is transactional in nature, meaning you input your credit card when you need to bid. You can also see all of their FAQ [here](https://support.moonpay.com/hc/en-gb/categories/360001595097-Customer-Support-Help-Centre)

### Is there a limit on the size of a credit card transaction?
You have a maximum of $10,000 you could bid using credit card


## Crypto 
###What should I fund my wallet with? 
All collections on RARE can be bid on and purchased with Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)
###How do I buy WETH? 
If you already have ETH, you can use [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) to get WETH.

If you don’t currently have ETH, and are looking at a drop that requires ETH, you can buy ETH from any major crypto exchange, [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/) also offers this. If you are looking to buy a large amount of ETH with Fiat we can facilitate this through onboarding you as a client and sending a wire to our brokerage armSDM.
