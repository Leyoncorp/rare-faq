# Connecting your wallet
### What type of wallets are supported?
RARE works with web3, and thus supports major wallets. We suggest using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) if you don’t already have a wallet.
### How do I connect my wallet to RARE?
Select the “connect” button and go through the prompts to add your wallet to RARE 
### What’s a hardware wallet? Should I be using one? 
Your wallet is only connected for as long as the session is active, you will be logged out as per Metamask. Since you have to connect and authenticate it each time, your wallet is never really connected to RARE, it just enables you to make purchases when it is connected. 
### What can I do to protect my wallet and RARE account?
Hardware wallets, also known as cold storage, are the industry standard for storing large amounts of funds personally, without a custody option. Some of the most popular hardware wallets on the market are Ledger and Trezor. Using a hardware wallet is up to your discretion, but with large amounts of funds it’s recommended.
